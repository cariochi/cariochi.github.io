# Introduction

## <mark style="color:orange;">Object-Oriented Regular Expressions</mark>

Expresso is a Java library that redefines how you work with regular expressions by introducing object-oriented principles. Unlike traditional regex engines, Expresso allows you to build modular, reusable, and hierarchical patterns that are easy to maintain and integrate into your applications. With Expresso, you can achieve more structured and readable solutions for complex text parsing tasks.

## <mark style="color:orange;">Key Features of Expresso</mark>

### Hierarchical Patterns

Define patterns in a class-like structure, enabling inheritance and reuse across multiple contexts. This makes your patterns modular and easy to extend.

### Named Group Exclusivity

Expresso focuses solely on named groups, ignoring unnamed ones to maintain clarity and alignment with object-oriented principles.

### Flexible Group Naming

Use non-standard group names like `@group`, `#number`, or even hierarchical names like `Class.Subclass.Field`, enabling better organization and readability.

### Reusable Classes

Define patterns once and reuse them across your application by referencing them like objects in your code.

### Comprehensive Java API

Leverage Expresso’s Java Matcher API to capture structured results, traverse hierarchical groups, and extract meaningful data with ease.

### Maintainable Patterns

By organizing patterns into reusable classes, Expresso minimizes redundancy and makes it easier to maintain large-scale regex-based projects.

### Structured Outputs

Generate structured outputs like JSON directly from matched patterns, making Expresso perfect for tasks like log parsing, data extraction, and domain-specific language processing.

### Interactivity and Integration

With Expresso’s [interactive demo](https://expresso.cariochi.com/), you can experiment with patterns and input text in real-time, ensuring precision before deploying them into your application.
